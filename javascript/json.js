// JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data, primarily in web applications. 
// JSON represents data as key-value pairs, making it easy to read for both humans and machines. 
// It is commonly used for communication between a server and a client due to its simplicity and ease of parsing across different programming languages.


// Example JSON fromat:
let json = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "skills": ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"],
    "address": {
        "city": "New York",
        "zipcode": "10001"
    }
}
console.log(json)
